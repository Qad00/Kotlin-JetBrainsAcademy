## Description
Connect Four is a classic game where players drop colorful discs onto a vertical board. 
The main goal of the game is to form a line of four discs of the same color horizontally, 
vertically, or diagonally.

In this project, will create a software version of this game. 
Typically, the game board has 6 rows and 7 columns, but in this version,
the number of rows and columns can vary from 5 to 9.

When a player wins a game, they get 2 points. If it's a draw, give 1 point to each player.
If the players have chosen the multiple game option, alternate the first move for each new game. 
However, each player retains the same disc symbol.
